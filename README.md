# REST-library
A simple REST API that represent Library.

There are 3 tables: `Subject`, `Teacher` and `Room`.

One Subject has many Teachers and one Teacher must has at least one Subject and one Room.

## Getting started
1. Clone project:
```
git clone https://github.com/Introduction-in-SWE/ScheduleFECT.git
```

2. Open `src/main/resources/application.properties` file and enter instead `<data_base_name>` name you want for your data base:
```
spring.datasource.dbname=<data_base_name>
```
2.1. The API will up on built in data base H2 and DB file will store here: `src/main/resources/db`, so if you restart API you don't lose your data.
Also you can change DB file location if you want:
```
spring.datasource.dbpath=./src/main/resources/db
```
2.2. It is also possible to up API using SQL data base. To do this, just change thre last config properties to:
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/${spring.datasource.dbname}?serverTimezone=UTC
spring.datasource.driverClassName=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL57Dialect
```

3. Load root project folder in console and run command:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Or import project as Maven project and just run main method in `App` class from `src/main/java/ua/com/epam/app` package;

4. Swagger with documentation will be available on:
```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```

5. If you use built in H2 data base, you can reach something like SQL Workbench. To up it change `spring.h2.console.enabled` property to `true`:
```
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
```
Rebuild project. H2 console will be available on:
```
http://localhost:8080/h2-workbench
```
In opened window leave all inputs as default expect `JDBC URL`. Here you must paste `jdbc:h2:file:<absolute_path_to_db_file>`. Look step `2.1.`
e.g. `jdbc:h2:D:/PhD/SWE/Бази даних/REST-library-API-master/REST-library-API-master/src/main/resources/db/library`

## Data ingestion (not implemented)
It is realized random data ingestion in `DataIngestion` class by `src/main/java/ua/com/epam` path. To generate some random data run main method from this class;

It is possible to configure counts of every object:
```
private final static int teachersCount = 150;
private final static int subjectsCount = 30;
private final static int roomsCount = 1000;
```
Note the comments on these fields.

When generation will be finished, go to `resources`. Here will be generated `addData.sh` script file. Just run it and wait for DB filling.

After that you can fully feel all opportunities of REST Library API.
